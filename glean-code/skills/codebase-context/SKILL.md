description: Use when the user wants architectural context about a specific system, service, or component from internal code repositories. Triggers on "what is [system]", "how does [service] work", "give me context on [component]", "understand [system] architecture", or similar architectural exploration requests.

# Codebase Context

Gather comprehensive architectural context about an internal system by searching code and documentation across the organization.

## Core Principles

- **Breadth before depth**: Find all relevant pieces before diving deep
- **Docs + code**: Both tell important parts of the story
- **Be skeptical**: Not every search result is relevant context
- **Freshness matters**: Stale docs can mislead

## Process

### Phase 1: Find the Code

Search for the system's codebase across all repositories:

```
code_search "[system] main OR core updated:past_month"
code_search "[system] service handler"
```

Look for:
- Main entry points and core modules
- API definitions (REST, gRPC, GraphQL)
- Key data structures and models

### Phase 2: Find the Documentation

Search for architecture and design docs:

```
search "[system] architecture OR design doc"
search "[system] RFC OR proposal"
search "[system] runbook OR playbook"
```

### Phase 3: Identify Key Contributors

Find who's actively working on this system:

```
code_search "[system] owner:* updated:past_month"
```

Cross-reference with `employee_search` for contact info.

### Phase 4: Vet All Content

For each piece of content, evaluate:

| Test | ✅ Include | ⚠️ Note | ❌ Reject |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Relevance** | Core component, directly relevant | Mentions system but not central | Keyword coincidence |
| **Currency** | <6 months, matches code | 6-12 months | 12+ months with no activity |
| **Authority** | Approved RFC, design doc, official runbook | Team wiki, notes, drafts | Outdated proposals, abandoned work |
| **Doc/Code consistency** | Docs reflect current state | Note discrepancy, prefer code | Doc significantly wrong — warn user |

**Repository Health:**
- ✅ ACTIVE: Commits in past month
- ⚠️ SLOWING: Last commit 1-6 months ago
- ❌ STALE: No commits in 6+ months

### Phase 5: Generate Vetted Context Report

```markdown
# Codebase Context: [System Name]

## Freshness Check
| Component | Last Updated | Status |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Main repo | [date] | Active / Slowing / Stale |
| Design doc | [date] | Current / Aging / Outdated |

## Overview
[1-2 paragraph summary synthesized from current docs — note age of sources]

## Key Repositories
| Repository | Purpose | Last Active | Status |
|------------|---------|-------------|--------|
| [repo] | [what it does] | [date] | Active / Stale |

## Architecture Highlights
[Only include if from recent/authoritative sources]
- **API Layer**: [description] (source: [doc], updated [date])
- **Data Model**: [description]
- **Key Dependencies**: [list]

## Documentation (Vetted)

### Current & Authoritative
| Doc | Type | Updated | Summary |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| [Title] | RFC | [date] | [summary] |

### Use With Caution (Aging)
| Doc | Type | Updated | Caveat |
|-----|------|---------|--------|
| [Title] | Design doc | [date] | May not reflect current implementation |

## Key Contributors
| Name | Role | Last Active | Contact |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
| [Name] | [Title] | [date] | [email] |

## Related Systems
- **Upstream**: [systems that call this one]
- **Downstream**: [systems this one calls]

## Warnings
- [ ] [Any concerns about the system's state]
```

## If Limited Context Found

```markdown
# Codebase Context: [System Name]

## Limited Context Available

Found limited authoritative information about this system.

**What I found:** [code/docs summary]
**Gaps:** No recent design documentation, no clear architectural overview

**Suggested next steps:**
1. Check with [suggested team/person]
2. Explore the code directly: [suggested entry points]
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Results Found
- Try alternative system names or acronyms
- Search for related technologies
- Check if the system might be in a private repo

### Conflicting Information
- Note the discrepancy clearly
- Prefer code as source of truth for current state
- Reference doc dates to identify which might be outdated
