description: Use when the user wants to find similar implementations or alternative approaches to a code pattern across internal repositories. Triggers on "is there already code for", "find similar implementations of", "how do other teams implement [pattern]", "prior art for [feature]", or similar discovery requests before building something new.

# Similar Code

Search for similar implementations across the organization to find prior art, alternative approaches, or shared solutions.

## Core Principles

- **Find the blessed path**: Look for official/platform solutions first
- **Compare approaches**: Different solutions have different tradeoffs
- **Be skeptical**: Not every implementation is worth following
- **Quality over quantity**: 3 vetted implementations beats 10 random matches

## Process

### Phase 1: Search for Direct Implementations

Look for the pattern/feature across all repos:

```
code_search "[topic] implementation"
code_search "[topic] handler OR service"
code_search "[topic] util OR helper"
```

### Phase 2: Search for Alternative Terms

The same concept might be named differently:

```
code_search "[synonym] implementation"
code_search "[synonym] service"
```

For example, "rate limiting" might also be called "throttling", "quota", "backpressure".

### Phase 3: Find Shared Libraries

Look for centralized implementations:

```
code_search "[topic] package OR library"
search "[topic] shared library OR common"
```

### Phase 4: Find Related Discussions

Search for design discussions about this pattern:

```
search "[topic] design doc OR RFC"
search "[topic] best practices OR guidelines"
```

### Phase 5: Vet Each Implementation

For each implementation found, evaluate:

| Test | ✅ Recommended | ⚠️ Acceptable | ❌ Reject |
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **Quality** | Clean, tested, well-maintained, follows best practices | Works but has caveats | Hacky, untested, deprecated |
| **Maintenance** | Commits in past 3 months | Last commit 3-12 months ago | No activity in 12+ months |
| **Adoption** | Deployed, actively used | Small usage, may have issues | Experiments, abandoned PRs |
| **Ownership** | Clear maintainer, responds to issues | Works but no clear owner | Orphaned, no maintenance |

**Anti-Pattern Signals — reject or warn:**
- In `/deprecated/`, `/old/`, `/legacy/` paths
- Large commented-out sections
- TODOs indicating known issues
- Skipped tests, no tests at all
- Copy-pasted boilerplate

### Phase 6: Present Vetted Comparison

```markdown
# Similar Implementations: [Pattern]

## Vetting Summary
| Found | Recommended | Acceptable | Rejected |
|-------|-------------|------------|----------|
| [X] | [Y] | [Z] | [W] |

## Recommended Solution
- **Library**: [name] ([link])
- **Maintained by**: [team/person]
- **Status**: Active, [X] commits in past month
- **Recommendation**: ⭐ Use this instead of building your own

## Vetted Implementations

### ⭐ [Repo Name] — RECOMMENDED
**Quality**: High
**Location:** [path] ([link])
**Last Updated**: [date]
**Maintainer**: [person/team]

**Approach:** [brief description]

**Why recommended:**
- [specific positive pattern]

### [Repo Name] — ACCEPTABLE
**Quality**: Good with caveats
**Location:** [path] ([link])
**Last Updated**: [date]

**Pros:** [advantage]
**Cons:** [limitation]

## Rejected Implementations
| Repo | Reason |
|------|--------|
| [repo] | No commits in 18 months, likely outdated |
| [repo] | Prototype code, never production-ready |

## Pattern Analysis
| Pattern | Used By | Quality | Recommendation |
|---------|---------|---------|----------------|
| [Pattern A] | [X] repos | Good | Follow this approach |
| [Pattern B] | [Y] repos | Mixed | Avoid unless [condition] |

## Recommendations

1. **Best option**: Use [recommended implementation] because [reason]
2. **If that doesn't fit**: Consider [alternative] for [use case]
3. **Avoid**: Don't follow [anti-pattern] approach
```

## If No Good Implementations Found

```markdown
# Similar Implementations: [Pattern]

## No Recommended Implementations Found

Searched for implementations of [pattern] but didn't find any I'd recommend following.

**What I found:** [X] matches, but all were [outdated/low quality/abandoned]

**Suggested next steps:**
1. Check for external libraries: [suggestions]
2. Ask in [relevant Slack channel] about approaches
3. If building new, consider making it a shared library
```
