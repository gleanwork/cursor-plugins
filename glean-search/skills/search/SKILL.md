# Structured Glean Search

Perform a structured search across Glean enterprise knowledge and return vetted, quality-assessed results.

## Core Principles

- **Relevance over completeness**: Show the best results, not all results
- **Be skeptical**: Not every keyword match is relevant
- **Context matters**: Include enough info to assess relevance

## Search Process

### 1. Identify the Query

Gather the search topic from the user's request or current conversation context.

### 2. Execute Search

Use the Glean search tool with the user's query. Return the most relevant results.

### 3. Assess Results

For each result, evaluate:

**Relevance**:
- ✅ RELEVANT: Actually about the query topic
- ❌ SKIP: Keyword coincidence, different context

**Currency**:
- ✅ CURRENT: Recent update
- ⚠️ OLD: May be outdated

Only show results that pass the relevance check. If old, note it.

### 4. Present Vetted Results

For each included result:
- **Title** (as a clickable link if URL available)
- **Source** (app/datasource)
- **Last updated** (with freshness indicator: ✅ <6mo, ⚠️ 6-12mo, ❌ >12mo)
- **Snippet** (relevant excerpt)
- **Relevance note** (why this matches)

### 5. Note Quality

After results, include:
- How many results were found vs. shown
- Any concerns about result quality
- Suggestions if results seem limited

### 6. Offer Follow-up Actions

After showing results, offer next steps:
- Read a document in full
- Refine search with filters
- Search a related topic

## Example Output

```markdown
## Search Results: [query]

Found [X] results, showing top [Y] most relevant:

### 1. [Title] ✅
**Source**: Confluence | **Updated**: 2 weeks ago ✅
> [Relevant snippet...]

**Why relevant**: [Brief note on why this matches]

### 2. [Title] ⚠️
**Source**: Slack | **Updated**: 8 months ago ⚠️
> [Relevant snippet...]

**Why relevant**: [Note] | **Caveat**: May be outdated

---

**Quality note**: [X] results filtered out (keyword matches in different context)

**If these don't help**: Try [alternative search suggestion]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Glean MCP Not Connected
If you see errors about missing `mcp__glean` tools:
- Check `~/.cursor/mcp.json` for a Glean server entry
- Use the mcp-setup skill to configure a connection

### No Results Found
If search returns no results:
- Suggest alternative keywords or phrasings
- Try removing specific terms that might be too narrow
- Check if this might be in a restricted system

### Too Many Results
If too many results appear:
- Apply stricter relevance filtering
- Suggest adding filters (owner, date range, app)
- Focus on most recent and most relevant
