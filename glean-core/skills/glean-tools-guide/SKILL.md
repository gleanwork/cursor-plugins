# Glean Tools Selection Guide

This skill provides guidance on selecting and using Glean MCP tools effectively.

## Skills vs Agents vs Commands

This plugin uses three component types:
- **Skills** (like this one): Auto-triggered guidance that helps select the right tools
- **Agents** (e.g., `enterprise-searcher`): Autonomous workers spawned for complex multi-step tasks
- **Commands** (e.g., `/glean-search:search`): User-triggered structured workflows

Skills provide knowledge; agents do work; commands orchestrate workflows.

## Tool Naming Convention

Glean MCP tools follow the pattern:
```
mcp__glean_[server-name]__[tool]
```

Where `[server-name]` is dynamic and configured per user (e.g., `default`, `production`, `acme`). The tool suffix is always consistent. When invoking tools, use whatever Glean server is available in your tool list.

## Available Tools Overview

| Tool Suffix | Purpose | Use When |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| `search` | Document discovery | Finding docs, wikis, policies, specs |
| `employee_search` | People lookup | Finding people, org chart, teams |
| `meeting_lookup` | Meeting search | Finding meetings, transcripts, decisions |
| `gmail_search` | Email search | Finding emails, attachments |
| `code_search` | Code discovery | Finding internal code, commits |
| `user_activity` | Activity feed | Finding your recent actions and interactions |
| `read_document` | Full content | Reading complete document by URL |
| `chat` | AI synthesis | Complex analysis across sources |

## Tool Selection Decision Tree

```
User question about...
├── People, "who", org chart → employee_search
├── Meetings, decisions, action items → meeting_lookup
├── Emails, attachments → gmail_search
├── Internal code, commits → code_search
├── "My activity", "what have I done", recent actions → user_activity
├── Documents, policies, specs → search
├── Need full document content → read_document (with URL)
└── Complex multi-source analysis → chat
```

## Critical Rules

### 1. Never Use Regular Search for People
```
# WRONG
search "John Smith"

# CORRECT
employee_search "John Smith"
```

### 2. Search → Read Workflow
When users need document details:
1. First: `search` to find documents
2. Then: `read_document` with URL from results

### 3. Use Chat for Synthesis
When the question requires reasoning across multiple sources:
```
chat "What are our authentication best practices based on recent RFCs and security policies?"
```

## Query Filter Reference

### Document Search (search) - Structured Parameters

The `search` tool uses **separate parameters** (not inline query filters):

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `query` | string | Keywords to find documents (required) |
| `owner` | string | Filter by document creator (`"person name"`, `"me"`, `"myteam"`) |
| `from` | string | Filter by who updated/commented/created (`"person name"`, `"me"`, `"myteam"`) |
| `updated` | string | Filter by update date (`today`, `yesterday`, `past_week`, `past_2_weeks`, `past_month`, or month name) |
| `after` | string | Documents created after date (`YYYY-MM-DD` format, no future dates) |
| `before` | string | Documents created before date (`YYYY-MM-DD` format) |
| `app` | enum | Filter by datasource (e.g., `confluence`, `github`, `gdrive`, `slack`, `jira`, `notion`) |
| `type` | enum | Filter by type: `pull`, `spreadsheet`, `slides`, `email`, `direct message`, `folder` |
| `channel` | string | Filter by Slack channel name |
| `exhaustive` | boolean | Return all matching results (use for "all", "each", "every" requests) |
| `sort_by_recency` | boolean | Sort by newest first (only when user wants "latest" or "most recent") |

### Code Search Filters (code_search) - Inline Query Syntax

Code search uses **inline filters in the query string**:

**Person Filters:**
- `owner:"person name"` or `owner:me` - Filter by commit creator
- `from:"person name"` or `from:me` - Filter by code file/commit updater

**Date Filters:**
- `updated:today|yesterday|past_week|past_month` - Filter by update date
- `after:YYYY-MM-DD` - Commits/files changed after date
- `before:YYYY-MM-DD` - Commits/files changed before date

### Employee Search Filters (employee_search) - Inline Query Syntax

- `reportsto:"manager name"` - Find direct reports (NOT for finding who someone reports to)
- `startafter:YYYY-MM-DD` - People who started after date
- `startbefore:YYYY-MM-DD` - People who started before date
- `roletype:"individual contributor"|"manager"` - Filter by role type
- `sortby:hire_date_ascending|hire_date_descending|most_reports` - Sort results

### Meeting Lookup Filters (meeting_lookup) - Inline Query Syntax

**Important**: meeting_lookup works best with natural language queries. Date filter syntax does NOT work reliably.

**Natural language dates (recommended):**
- "standup last week" - Meetings from last week
- "design review past 2 weeks" - Recent meetings
- "1:1 with John tomorrow" - Future meetings
- "team sync yesterday" - Yesterday's meetings

**Other filters that work:**
- `participants:"name"` - Filter by attendees
- `topic:"subject"` - Filter by meeting subject/title
- `extract_transcript:"true"` - Include meeting content/transcript

**Note:** Inline date filters (`after:`, `before:`) do not work reliably with meeting_lookup. Use natural language dates instead.

### Gmail Search Filters (gmail_search) - Inline Query Syntax

- `from:"person"|"email@domain.com"|"me"` - Filter by sender
- `to:"person"|"email@domain.com"|"me"` - Filter by recipient
- `subject:"text"` - Filter by subject line
- `has:attachment|document|spreadsheet|presentation` - Filter by attachment type
- `is:important|starred|read|unread|snoozed` - Filter by email status
- `label:INBOX|SENT|TRASH|DRAFT|SPAM` - Filter by folder/label
- `after:YYYY-MM-DD` / `before:YYYY-MM-DD` - Date range

### User Activity Parameters (user_activity)

The `user_activity` tool uses date range parameters (not query filters):
- `start_date` - Start date in YYYY-MM-DD format (inclusive, required)
- `end_date` - End date in YYYY-MM-DD format (exclusive, required)

Use for: standup notes, weekly summaries, 1:1 prep, finding documents you touched but forgot.

## Example Tool Calls

These examples show the correct syntax for each tool type.

### Search (Structured Parameters)

Pass filters as separate parameters, not in the query string:

```
search(query="authentication RFC", app="confluence", updated="past_month")
search(query="API design", owner="me", sort_by_recency=true)
search(query="onboarding guide", from="John Smith", after="2024-01-01")
```

### Code Search (Inline Filters)

Include filters directly in the query string:

```
code_search("authentication handler owner:me updated:past_week")
code_search("payment processor after:2024-06-01 before:2024-12-01")
code_search("API endpoint from:\"Jane Doe\"")
```

### Employee Search (Inline Filters)

Include filters directly in the query string:

```
employee_search("engineering manager reportsto:\"VP Engineering\"")
employee_search("backend engineer startafter:2024-01-01")
employee_search("data scientist roletype:\"individual contributor\"")
```

### Meeting Lookup (Natural Language + Inline Filters)

Use natural language for dates; inline filters for other criteria:

```
meeting_lookup("my meetings today extract_transcript:\"true\"")
meeting_lookup("standup last week participants:\"John Smith\"")
meeting_lookup("design review past 2 weeks topic:\"architecture\"")
```

Note: Date filters (`after:`, `before:`) are documented but don't work reliably in practice. Use natural language dates instead ("today", "yesterday", "last week", "past 2 weeks").

### User Activity (Structured Parameters)

Pass date range as separate parameters:

```
user_activity(start_date="2024-01-08", end_date="2024-01-15")
```

## Filter Best Practices

**Structured vs Inline Filters:**
- `search` uses **structured parameters** - pass filters as separate tool arguments
- `code_search`, `employee_search`, `gmail_search`, `meeting_lookup` use **inline filters** in the query string

**When to Use Date Filters:**
- Use `updated:` for relative timeframes ("last week", "past month")
- Use `after:`/`before:` for date ranges ("between Jan and March", "since 2024")
- Avoid date filters for "latest" or "recent" without specific timeframe
- For `meeting_lookup`, prefer natural language dates over inline filters

**Person Filter Guidelines:**
- Use quotes for multi-word names: `from:"John Smith"`
- Use `owner:` for document creators, `from:` for broader involvement
- Use `me` when user refers to themselves

**Search Strategy:**
- Start broad, then narrow with filters if too many results
- For `search`: add filter parameters to narrow results
- For other tools: add inline filters to the query string
- Use the `exhaustive` parameter on `search` for exhaustive results ("all", "each", "every")

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Don't use `after:` with future dates
- For `search`, pass `channel` and `app` as separate parameters
- Quote multi-word filter values in inline syntax: `from:"John Smith"`

## Best Practices

1. **Cite sources**: Always include URLs so users can verify
2. **Start broad, then narrow**: Use filters to refine if too many results
3. **Combine signals**: For expertise, check code + docs + meetings
4. **Respect permissions**: Results are filtered by user access
5. **Note when empty**: No results is useful information
