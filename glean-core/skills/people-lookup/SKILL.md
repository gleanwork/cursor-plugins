# People Lookup via Glean

When users ask about people in the organization, use Glean's employee search and activity signals to find the right person.

## Tool Naming

See the `glean-tools-guide` skill for Glean MCP tool naming conventions. Tools follow the pattern `mcp__glean_[server-name]__[tool]` where the server name is dynamic. Use whatever Glean server is available in your tool list.

## When This Applies

Use this approach when users ask:
- "Who works on [system/project]?"
- "Who is [name]?" or "What team is [name] on?"
- "Who should I talk to about [topic]?"
- "Who owns [component/service]?"
- "Who reports to [manager]?"
- "Find someone who knows about [technology]"

## BE SKEPTICAL

Not everyone who appears in search results is a good recommendation.

**Expertise Evidence Test**
- Is there real evidence of expertise?
- ✅ STRONG: Multiple signals (code + docs + involvement)
- ⚠️ MODERATE: Single signal but significant
- ❌ WEAK: Just mentioned once, attended a meeting

**Recency Test**
- Are they actively involved?
- ✅ ACTIVE: Activity in past 6 months
- ⚠️ HISTORICAL: 6-12 months ago
- ❌ STALE: 12+ months - likely outdated

**Availability Test**
- Are they still in a relevant position?
- ✅ CURRENT: Same team/role
- ⚠️ MOVED: Changed teams but retains knowledge
- ❌ GONE: Left company or completely different role

**Filter Out**:
- Single mentions without other evidence
- People who just attended meetings on a topic
- Former employees
- People whose involvement is tangential

**Quality over quantity**: Better to recommend 2 right people than 10 weak matches.

## Tool Selection

| User Intent | Glean Tool |
|-------------|------------|
| Find by name, role, team | `employee_search` |
| Find by code contributions | `code_search` |
| Find by document authorship | `search` with `owner:` filter |
| Complex expertise analysis | `chat` |

## Critical: Use employee_search for People Queries

**Never use regular `search` for people lookups.** The `employee_search` tool is specifically designed for:
- Name lookups
- Role/title searches
- Team/department queries
- Org chart navigation
- Reporting relationships

## Query Examples

```
# Find by name
employee_search "John Smith"

# Find by team
employee_search "payments team"

# Find direct reports
employee_search "reportsto:\"Jane Doe\""

# Find by role type
employee_search "engineering managers"

# Find recent hires
employee_search "startafter:2024-01-01"
```

## Finding Expertise (Not Just Role)

For "who actually knows about X" questions, combine signals:

1. **Official role**: `employee_search "[topic]"`
2. **Code activity**: `code_search "[topic] owner:\"name\""`
3. **Doc authorship**: `search "[topic] RFC owner:\"name\""`

**People with multiple signals are true experts.** Single-signal matches should be noted with lower confidence.

## If No Good Matches Found

Don't pad with weak recommendations:

```markdown
No strong expertise matches found for [topic].

**What was checked:**
- Employee search: [results]
- Code contributions: [results]
- Doc authorship: [results]

**Suggestions:**
- Ask in [relevant channel]
- Check with [related team] leadership
```

- `/stakeholders` - Find who needs to be involved in a change
