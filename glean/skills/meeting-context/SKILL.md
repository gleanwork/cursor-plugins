# Meeting Context via Glean

When users need information from meetings - past discussions, decisions, action items, or transcripts - use Glean's meeting lookup.

## Tool Naming

See the `glean-tools-guide` skill for Glean MCP tool naming conventions. Tools follow the pattern `mcp__glean_[server-name]__[tool]` where the server name is dynamic. Use whatever Glean server is available in your tool list.

## When This Applies

Use this approach when users ask:
- "What was decided in the [topic] meeting?"
- "What action items came out of [meeting]?"
- "When did we discuss [topic]?"
- "What meetings did I miss [time period]?"
- "Who attended [meeting]?"
- "What was said about [topic] in recent meetings?"

## Primary Tool

Use the Glean `meeting_lookup` tool with natural language queries.

## Query Syntax

**Important**: meeting_lookup works best with natural language queries. Date filter syntax does NOT work reliably.

```
# By topic and time (natural language)
meeting_lookup "quarterly planning last week"

# With specific participants
meeting_lookup "standup with John Smith"
meeting_lookup "participants:\"John Smith\" topic:\"standup\""

# Get transcript content
meeting_lookup "team sync last week extract_transcript:\"true\""

# Today's meetings
meeting_lookup "my meetings today"

# Past week
meeting_lookup "meetings past week"
```

## Date Filtering

**Use natural language for dates:**
- "last week", "past 2 weeks", "yesterday", "today", "tomorrow"
- "meetings since Monday", "standups this month"

**Inline date filters do NOT work reliably:**
- `after:now-1w` - Date math is ignored
- `after:YYYY-MM-DD` - ISO dates return no results
- `after:yesterday` - Simple keywords don't work as filter values

**Filters that do work:**
- `participants:"name"` - Filter by attendees
- `topic:"subject"` - Filter by meeting topic
- `extract_transcript:"true"` - Include transcript content

## When to Extract Transcripts

Add `extract_transcript:"true"` when you need:
- Specific quotes or statements
- Detailed discussion content
- Action item context
- Decision rationale

Skip transcripts for:
- Just listing meetings
- Checking attendees
- Quick time/date lookup

## What to Extract from Meetings

When analyzing meeting content, focus on:
1. **Decisions made** - What was agreed? By whom?
2. **Action items** - Tasks assigned, owners, deadlines
3. **Open questions** - Unresolved items
4. **Key discussion points** - Important debates or context
