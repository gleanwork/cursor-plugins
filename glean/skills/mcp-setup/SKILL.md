# Glean MCP Server Setup

Help the user configure a Glean MCP server for Cursor. This workflow can be repeated to add multiple servers.

## Setup Flow

### Step 1: Get Instance Name

Ask the user for their Glean instance name. If their Glean URL is `https://acme-be.glean.com`, their instance name is `acme`.

You can find your Glean URL here: <https://app.glean.com/admin/about-glean>

### Step 2: Get Server Name

Ask the user for the server name they want to connect to. Their Glean administrator should have provided this. Common examples include `default`, but server names are organization-specific.

### Step 3: Configure MCP Server

Once you have both values, instruct the user to add the following to their `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "glean": {
      "url": "https://[instance]-be.glean.com/mcp/[server-name]"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `[instance]` with their instance name and `[server-name]` with the server name.

### Step 4: Confirm Success

After configuration:

1. Confirm the server entry was added to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
2. Remind the user to restart Cursor to activate the new server
3. Explain that they'll be prompted to authenticate on first use (OAuth)
4. Offer to walk through setup again if they want to add another server

## Important Notes

- The URL format is: `https://[instance]-be.glean.com/mcp/[server-name]`
- The `-be` suffix is required (it's the backend endpoint)
- Cursor handles OAuth authentication automatically on first tool use
- The MCP configuration file is at `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
