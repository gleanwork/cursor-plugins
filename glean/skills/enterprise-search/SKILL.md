# Enterprise Search via Glean

When users ask about internal company information that lives in enterprise systems (not the local codebase), use Glean tools to find it.

## Tool Naming

See the `glean-tools-guide` skill for Glean MCP tool naming conventions. Tools follow the pattern `mcp__glean_[server-name]__[tool]` where the server name is dynamic. Use whatever Glean server is available in your tool list.

## When This Applies

Use Glean search when users ask about:
- Company policies, guidelines, or procedures
- Design documents, RFCs, or specifications
- Internal wikis or knowledge base articles
- Project documentation or roadmaps
- Slack discussions or announcements
- Any "where is the doc about X" questions

## BE SKEPTICAL

Not every search result is relevant or current. Before presenting results, evaluate:

**Relevance Test**
- Does this actually answer the question, or just contain keywords?
- ✅ INCLUDE: Directly addresses the query
- ❌ EXCLUDE: Keyword coincidence, different context

**Freshness Test**
- Is this information current?
- ✅ CURRENT: Updated in past 6 months
- ⚠️ AGING: 6-12 months - note the age
- ❌ STALE: 12+ months - include only with strong warning, or exclude

**Authority Test**
- How reliable is this source?
- 📗 OFFICIAL: Approved policies, signed-off specs
- 📙 SEMI-OFFICIAL: Team wikis, shared docs
- 📕 INFORMAL: Slack discussions, personal notes

**Filter Out**:
- Superseded or deprecated documents
- Draft documents presented as final
- Keyword matches in unrelated contexts

**See `confidence-signals` skill** for how to communicate reliability.

## Tool Selection

| User Intent | Glean Tool |
|-------------|------------|
| Find documents, policies, specs | `search` |
| Complex analysis across sources | `chat` |
| Read full document content | `read_document` |

## Query Optimization

Glean understands natural language. Enhance queries with filters when helpful:

```
# Recent documents
"API documentation updated:past_week"

# By author
"design doc owner:\"Sarah Chen\""

# Date range
"quarterly planning after:2024-01-01"

# Specific app
"authentication RFC app:confluence"
```

## Workflow

1. **Search first**: Use `search` to find relevant documents
2. **Vet results**: Apply vetting criteria before presenting
3. **Read for details**: Use `read_document` with URLs from vetted results
4. **Synthesize if complex**: Use `chat` for multi-source analysis

## Always Include Quality Signals

When presenting information from Glean, always include:
- Document title and URL
- Last updated date (with freshness indicator: ✅/<6mo, ⚠️ 6-12mo, ❌ >12mo)
- Author (if relevant)
- Confidence level (see `confidence-signals` skill)

This allows users to assess reliability and explore further.

## If Nothing Relevant Found

Don't pad with weak results:

```markdown
No relevant results found for [query].

**What was searched:**
- [Search terms used]

**Suggestions:**
- Try alternative terms: [suggestions]
- Ask in [relevant channel]
- This may not be documented
```
