# Glean Result Vetting

When presenting results from Glean MCP tools, always vet before showing:

**Relevance**: Does this actually answer the question, or just contain matching keywords? Reject keyword coincidences.

**Freshness**: Is this current?
- ✅ <6 months: include with confidence
- ⚠️ 6-12 months: include with staleness note
- ❌ 12+ months: exclude unless no alternatives (with strong warning)

**Authority**: How reliable is the source?
- Official (RFCs, approved specs) > Semi-official (team wikis) > Informal (Slack, personal notes)

**Quality over quantity**: 3 vetted results beats 10 unvetted mentions. "Nothing relevant found" is a valid and useful answer — never pad with weak results.

Always include: document title, URL, last updated date, and confidence level when presenting Glean results.
