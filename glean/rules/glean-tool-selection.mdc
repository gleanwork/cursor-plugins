# Glean Tool Selection

When Glean MCP tools are available (tools matching `mcp__glean_*`), use the correct tool for each query type:

- **People queries** ("who works on", "who owns", org chart) → `employee_search` (NEVER use `search` for people)
- **Meeting queries** (decisions, action items, transcripts) → `meeting_lookup` with natural language dates
- **Email queries** (messages, attachments) → `gmail_search`
- **Code queries** (implementations, patterns, commits) → `code_search`
- **Activity queries** ("what have I done", standup prep) → `user_activity`
- **Document queries** (policies, specs, wikis) → `search`
- **Full document content** → `read_document` with URL from search results
- **Complex multi-source analysis** → `chat`

**Key rules:**
- Use `search` with structured parameters (separate `owner`, `app`, `updated` arguments)
- Use `code_search`, `employee_search`, `gmail_search` with inline query filters
- Use `meeting_lookup` with natural language dates (inline date filters are unreliable)
- Always cite sources with URLs so users can verify
