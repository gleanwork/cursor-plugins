# Glean for Cursor

Official Glean plugin for [Cursor](https://cursor.com) — enterprise search, code exploration,
and people discovery directly in your development workflow.

## Setup

### 1. Install the plugin

Install from the [Cursor marketplace](https://cursor.com/marketplace/glean).

### 2. Set up Glean

Start Cursor and prompt the harness to set up Glean, for example: `Set up
Glean for me`. Complete the browser OAuth flow when prompted, then return to
Cursor.

## What's Included

The plugin ships a library of skills (plus supporting agents and rules) that
auto-trigger by task — there's no per-skill install. They cover:

- **Enterprise search & knowledge** — find documents, Slack messages, and email; vet results for freshness and authority.
- **Code across repos** — explore implementations, find usage examples and similar code, identify code owners, and gather architectural context.
- **People & org** — find experts by contribution, and identify stakeholders for a change or project.
- **Meetings** — prep for upcoming meetings and catch up on what you missed.
- **Onboarding & projects** — ramp up on a team or area, read quick project status, and generate comprehensive project handoffs.
- **Personal productivity** — summarize your own activity, prep status updates, and surface what needs your attention.
- **Skill authoring** — discover automation opportunities and generate new skills.

The plugin provides a local Glean MCP server. If no Glean tools are visible,
ask the user to set up Glean by prompting the harness (for example, `Set up
Glean for me`).
