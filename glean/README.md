# Glean for Cursor

Official Glean plugin for [Cursor](https://cursor.com) — enterprise search, code exploration,
and people discovery directly in your development workflow.

## Setup

### 1. Install the plugin

```
/add-plugin glean
```

### 2. Configure your Glean MCP server

Add your server to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "glean": {
      "url": "https://YOUR-INSTANCE-be.glean.com/mcp/YOUR-SERVER-NAME"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR-INSTANCE` with your Glean instance name and `YOUR-SERVER-NAME` with the server
name provided by your Glean administrator. Restart Cursor after editing — OAuth authentication
is handled automatically on first use.
